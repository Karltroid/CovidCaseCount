# CovidCaseCount
This was a program I made for my local town school system to parse through a list of addresses of households who had Covid and create a spread sheet of how many covid cases were at each address. The spreadsheet was formatted so that that data could be imported in Google Maps to see a visual "heatmap" of Covid cases for the town.
